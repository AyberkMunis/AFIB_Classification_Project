# AFIB_Classification_Project
* This project aims classifying AFIB disease by using patient's ECG records.
* ECG (Electrocardiogram) is records of electrical signal from heart to check patient's heart conditions.
* This project uses PTB XL database from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khyeh0719/ptb-xl-dataset). It includes 21,187 patient's ECG and personal data
* 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks are used as models in this project
* You can find a deployed model in this resptiory, the model is trained for 100 Hz (lr) data
